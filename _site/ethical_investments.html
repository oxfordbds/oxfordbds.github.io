      <p>In **** the University of Oxford launched an expedited review into its investment policy through the Ethical Investments Representation Review Sub-committee. This review process was open to all members of the Collegiate University, closing in February 2025. The University’s published TOR for this review can be found **<a href="https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/sites/ADMN-UASMosaicDocumentHub/Governance/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FADMN%2DUASMosaicDocumentHub%2FGovernance%2FEIRRS%20Review%20%2D%20terms%20of%20reference%2Epdf&amp;parent=%2Fsites%2FADMN%2DUASMosaicDocumentHub%2FGovernance">here</a>
This is a survey to assess what themes and recommended changes that were covered in a broad range of submissions to the expedited EIRRS review up until 24th Feb 2025. The goal of this survey is to highlight both the breadth of and agreement on common recommendations covered by submissions.</p>
<p>We will aggregate and host these results on the Oxford BDS Coalition website. In the field marked ‘Submission from’ you can included a group name where this is appropriate and if you submitted as an individual you can either identify yourself or input ‘individual submission’ as this field might be shared. Do not share your name if you do not want to be identified. There is also a request for you to share your submission with us to then host so that the wider community can read submissions. However, it is not necessary for you to share your submission to fill in this form.</p>
