The Oxford Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) Coalition is an activist-research collective that is comprised of staff and students at the University of Oxford who are committed to Palestinian liberation. Our primary purpose is to investigate the Collegiate Universityâ€™s ties to the Arms Trade and Israeli crimes against the Palestinian People, and campaign to sever these ties.

We stand in full solidarity with the student-led [Oxford Action for Palestine (OA4P) Solidarity Encampment](https://linktr.ee/oxact4pal). Please see our collective demands below:

1. Disclose University-wide Assets
2. Divest University-wide Assets 
3. Overhaul Investment Policy
4. Boycott Institutional Relationships
5. Drop Barclays 
6. Rebuild and Reinvest
