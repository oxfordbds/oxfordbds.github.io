<p><details><summary><strong><a>University of Oxford Staff and Research Students Commit to the BDS Movement for Palestine</a></strong></summary>
  
<br>


*Published April 2025*

As signatories of this pledge, we form a collective of staff and research students at the University of Oxford and its constituent Colleges who individually commit to the terms of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement. We do so in response to calls from Palestinian trade union, education, and civil society organizations – including the Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel (PACBI) and the Palestine Academy for Science and Technology – for international solidarity to end Israel’s regime of occupation, settler colonialism, apartheid, and now genocide in Gaza.**[(1)](#Note1)** We expect this call to be unchanged by any ceasefire agreement in Gaza: Israel has a documented history of violating and indeed nullifying ceasefire agreements, including that signed in January 2025, which in any case did not address the occupation in the West Bank or the wider apartheid regime.**[(2)](#Note2)**

Such egregious breaches of international law demand institutional action. Indeed, as legal observers have made clear, public institutions around the world, including universities, have a duty to respond to Israel’s actions to avoid institutional complicity. In assuming this responsibility, we urge members of the university to follow the lead of Oxford City Council, which on 24 March 2025 passed a motion precluding investment and trade with entities implicated in grave violations of human rights, citing its obligations to avoid complicity in Israel’s violations of international law.

Support for BDS is especially urgent for people of conscience working in higher education. In the year following October 2023, at least 117 university staff members and 681 university students were killed by Israeli forces in Gaza, and all 12 universities in Gaza were damaged or destroyed, along with 90% of school buildings, cultural centres, archives, libraries, and museums. A vocabulary of educide and scholasticide has emerged to describe these crimes committed by Israel in Palestine.**[(3)](#Note3)** And as the BDS movement has long shown, Israeli higher education institutions play a central role in supporting the Israeli occupation of Palestine and upholding apartheid.**[(4)](#Note4)** This includes systematically discriminating against Palestinian students and staff, as well as developing military systems, doctrines, and moral and legal rationales for Israeli crimes against Palestinians.

These issues are of direct importance at the University of Oxford, which is complicit through its current and historic institutional, financial, and academic relationships with companies and institutions implicated in Israeli crimes. These relationships, strengthened through years of collaboration, include, but are not limited to: documented ties to companies supplying the Israeli military, operating in illegal settlements, and sustaining the apartheid regime (e.g., by providing products or services that maintain the Apartheid Wall and checkpoints)**[(5)](#Note5)**; investments in companies implicated in Israeli crimes (through the endowments of the University and its Colleges, which stand at £8.1bn, the largest of any UK university); and relationships with Israeli universities that legitimise and implement occupation and apartheid policies while maintaining close ties to the military. A comprehensive report detailing these connections has been compiled by the Oxford BDS Coalition and was submitted to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR); its publication is expected to be forthcoming. 

The following information provides an indicative overview of institutional complicity at Oxford as of March 2025:

- The University of Oxford sustains relationships with arms companies whose products are used by Israel to commit war crimes against Palestinians. Between 2019 and 2024, The University received at least £10.6 million in donations and research funding from Rolls Royce plc, a supplier of power systems for Israeli armoured vehicles and a partner in the F-35 fighter jet programme.**[(6)](#Note6)** These jets, armed with 2,000-lb bombs, have been deployed in Israeli attacks on the Gaza Strip since October 2023, contributing to the systematic destruction of life and infrastructure. Historically, the University has partnered with RTX (Raytheon Technologies) and BAE Systems, both key suppliers of weapons to Israel and former collaborators through the Oxford-based quantum computing hub (2014-2019).

- Freedom of Information requests have identified at least £29 million in direct and indirect investment by the University and its Colleges into companies involved in Israel’s crimes.**[(7)](#Note7)[(8)](#Note8)** These include firms providing cloud computing, surveillance and AI technologies to the Israeli military (Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Palantir), arms and dual use companies supplying the Israeli military (Caterpillar, Toyota Motor, Elbit Systems, General Electric), and businesses operating in illegal settlements in the West Bank (AirBnB, Expedia Group, Booking.com). 

- The University fosters academic partnerships with Israeli institutions complicit in settler-colonialism, apartheid, and occupation. Notably, it maintains a student exchange partnership with the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, an institution which trains intelligence officers for the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) and partly operates on land expropriated from the Palestinian village of al-Issawiya in East Jerusalem. 

We, staff and research students at the University of Oxford and its constituent Colleges, pledge our commitment to the BDS movement as part of our broader solidarity with Palestinians against Israeli occupation, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and genocide. Specifically, we commit to the following actions:

1. Refusing to participate in any formal or informal engagement with Israeli higher education institutions. Following the PACBI guidelines, Israeli higher education institutions are assumed to be complicit in Israel’s crimes unless proven otherwise. The boycott does not apply to scholars at Israeli universities acting in their individual capacity. 
2. Refusing to participate in any formal or informal engagement with any corporation involved in supporting Israeli occupation, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, or genocide in Palestine. We note that the national policies of UCU, Unite and Unison support members’ rights to refuse complicity in Israeli apartheid and occupation through support of boycott, divestment, and sanctions campaigns.
3. Working to provide direct support for higher education institutions, academics, educators, and students in Palestine and specifically in Gaza. The PACBI guidelines make clear the importance of supporting Palestinian academic institutions without requiring them to partner with Israeli counterparts. 
4. Speaking out against all attempts to silence Palestine solidarity action and speech on our campus and beyond. Since October 2023, the University has issued police action and disciplinary procedures against students acting in solidarity with Palestine, as well as indirect threats to organizers of solidarity events. Signatories affirm the right of students to speech and assembly in solidarity with Palestine. 
5. Calling on the Vice-Chancellor and Council, as well as Governing Bodies in the Colleges, to end without delay the university’s investments in, and procurement contracts with, companies supplying weapons to the Israeli military. All other investments of the University and its Colleges must be made transparent and a divestment plan covering both direct and indirect connections to Israeli state crimes must be formulated. 
6. Supporting a wider BDS campaign at the University of Oxford and across the city of Oxford. Signatories commit to supporting the ongoing work of monitoring complicity, organizing colleagues, and supporting solidarity actions within and beyond the university.  

We call on leaders from across the Collegiate University to join us in committing to these principles, to ensure that Oxford, as a world-leading university, takes a firm stand against occupation, apartheid, ethnic cleansing, and genocide, whenever and wherever these may occur.

NOTES: 

<a name="Note1" style="color:black">


- (1) Numerous human rights organizations, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have determined that Israel's actions in Gaza since October 2023 constitute genocide, and the International Court of Justice (ICJ) has issued provisional measures to Israel to prevent genocide; measures Israel continues to ignore. Further, on 19 July 2024, the ICJ issued a landmark Advisory Opinion on the illegality of Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory, in response to which the UN General Assembly overwhelmingly adopted a resolution demanding that Israel end without delay its unlawful presence in occupied Palestinian territory.

<a name="Note2" style="color:black">


- (2) In the weeks following the ceasefire agreement of 19 January 2025, and in keeping with its history of violating ceasefire agreements, Israel continued to carry out strikes and attacks on Gaza, killing an estimated 155 Palestinians. At the same time, Israel launched an operation across several refugee camps in the West Bank, displacing 40,000 Palestinians as of 10 February. On 2 March, Israel imposed a blockade on all lifesaving supplies – including food, fuel, and medicine – entering Gaza. Israel resumed its bombardment of Gaza on 17 March 2025. Hundreds of Palestinians were killed in the first hours of this assault, which has unilaterally nullified the ceasefire agreement.
