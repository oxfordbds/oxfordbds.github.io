**Our BDS Pledge**

<details><summary><strong><a>Our collective demands to the Collegiate University</a></strong></summary>
  
1. Disclose University-wide Assets
2. Divest University-wide Assets 
3. Overhaul Investment Policy
4. Boycott Institutional Relationships
5. Drop Barclays 
6. Rebuild and Reinvest
   
We share these demands with the student-led [Oxford Action for Palestine (OA4P) Solidarity Encampment](https://linktr.ee/oxact4pal). The Primer on our demands to the University of Oxford can be found here: [https://oxfordbds.github.io/data/primer.pdf](https://oxfordbds.github.io/data/primer.pdf)


In November, 2024 - the ICJP lodged a formal complaint with the Charity Commission against one of Oxford’s Colleges for holding over £1 million in investments in illegal Israeli settlements. If you discover that a particular college at Oxford University has investments which may violate their ethical obligations, feel free to send in a complaint to the Charity Commission.

<!-- **BDS FOI METHODS EXPLAINER**

From this FOI campaign, 2 Colleges did not respond to any of our requests, failing their
statutory duty of responding to FOI requests within 20 working days.

1. Corpus Christi College
2. Magdalen College

16 colleges either outright refused to disclose any information on indirect investments
or did not disclose specific numbers on company-level data for their main pools of
Investments.

18 colleges provided information about their company-level holdings for at least some
of their indirect investments, by either providing names of funds they invest in that
have publicly accessible portfolios (along with the amount they invest in them), or by
providing PDFs of portfolios they invest in, or look-throughs they received from their
fund managers.

Using the data provided by colleges on company-level investments and their
endowment fund breakdown, we investigated the indirect investments colleges held.
Each college has their own investment policy, portfolios, and method of disclosure:
- For example, University College invests in 18 different funds and for their FOI
reply, the college provided scanned documents of each portfolio they had at the
time of the request. To investigate this required manually going through 27
pages of the document to look for specific companies and calculating the
estimated value invested in them as provided.
- Others were more straightforward, for example, All Souls College did not
provide a portfolio, but extracted the estimated investments in specific
companies from across their investment portfolios.
- Likewise, Merton College provided a look through of their portfolio in an excel
sheet format.
- Colleges such as New College and Queens College have partial investments in
portfolios whose company-level holdings data is publicly available. In these
cases, we used the number they provided on how much the College invested in
total in these specific funds to calculate the College’s company-level holdings.
For company-level holdings that required manual calculations, we ensured at least two
others of our team double checked and verified these numbers.

In our investigations, we specifically focused on how much each College invests in
companies involved in two types of egregious activities:
1. Commission of international crimes connected to Israel’s unlawful occupation,
racial segregation and apartheid regime in the occupied Palestinian territory
(oPt), by:
1.1. Supporting the Israeli military;
1.2. Supporting illegal Israeli settlements; and/or
1.3. Sustaining the apartheid regime.
2. Manufacture and/or proliferation of arms and dual use products (including
military technologies)
To identify the specific companies that are involved in these two egregious activities,
we refer to the databases listed below. If the company appears in any one of these
databases, it should be deemed as a sufficient condition to warrant its inclusion on the
exclusion list. -->
