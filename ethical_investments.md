In Michaelmas term 2024 University of Oxford launched an expedited review into its investment policy through the **[Ethical Investments Representation Review Sub-committee](https://governance.admin.ox.ac.uk/ethical-investment-representations-review-subcommittee/ethical-investments-review)**. This review process was open to all members of the Collegiate University, and closed in February 2025. The University's published TOR for this review can be found **[here](https://unioxfordnexus.sharepoint.com/sites/ADMN-UASMosaicDocumentHub/Governance/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FADMN%2DUASMosaicDocumentHub%2FGovernance%2FEIRRS%20Review%20%2D%20terms%20of%20reference%2Epdf&parent=%2Fsites%2FADMN%2DUASMosaicDocumentHub%2FGovernance)**. Based on this review, the University has said that they will respond in Trinity term 2025. 

**To make sure that the diversity of submissions can be seen by the community along with the University's response, we are gathering data through survey of submissions to assess what themes and recommendations were included.** The goal of this survey is to highlight both the breadth of and agreement on common recommendations covered by submissions. 

If you submitted to the EIRRS review please **[fill in our survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScmF-eOSWLNn_GmzQIid9JRscORFrBDCE_omxnFYt8-yKDxfw/viewform?usp=sharing)**.

*We will aggregate and update results from the survey here through April 2025.*
