<!--- Our primary purpose is to investigate the Collegiate Universityâ€™s ties to the Arms Trade and Israeli crimes against the Palestinian People, and campaign to sever these ties. Over the past year, the BDS Coalition had worked with the wider Oxford University community to develop shared collective demands for the Collegiate University, action roadmaps for Colleges and the University, and an archive of open research for current and future organisers.
