title: Roadmaps for change
---

The BDS Coalition and a coalition of members of the Oxford colleges have created roadmaps for change to support negotiations and organising in our community. These roadmaps include comprehensive steps colleges should take to increase transparency and divest from arms and Israeli crimes and respond to our collective demands to the Collegiate University.

*These roadmaps are being updated as information is collected and as changes are made at respective institutions. If you have information that is relevant and should be added to these roadmaps, please [contact us](mailto:bds.coalition.oxford@proton.me) to collaborate.*
